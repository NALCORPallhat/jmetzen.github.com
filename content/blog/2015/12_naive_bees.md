Summary: This is a documentation of my submission to the Naive Bees classification challenge, where I ended up on the second place (username frisbee). The challenge of the competition was to classify whether a bee is a honey bee (Apis) or a bumble bee (Bombus). According to the organizers, being able to identify bee species from images is a task that ultimately would allow researchers to more quickly and effectively collect field data. Pollinating bees have critical roles in both ecology and agriculture, and diseases like colony collapse disorder threaten these species.
