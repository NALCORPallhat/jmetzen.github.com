Summary: This post summarizes the new feature of calibrating predicted probabilities of binary and multi-class classifiers, which has been added in the 0.16 release of scikit-learn. It gives several examples, which illustrates both the different properties of under-confident and over-confident classifiers, and how to calibrate those such that they become well-calibrated.
