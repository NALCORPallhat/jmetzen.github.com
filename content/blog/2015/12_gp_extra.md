Summary: Starting from version 0.18 (already available in the post-0.17 master branch), scikit-learn will ship a completely revised Gaussian process module, supporting among other things kernel engineering. While scikit-learn only ships the most common kernels, the gp\_extra project contains some more advanced, non-standard kernels that can seamlessly be used with scikit-learn's GaussianProcessRegressor.
