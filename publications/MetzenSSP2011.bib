        abstract = {Machine learning approaches are increasingly used in brain-machine-interfaces to
allow automatic adaptation to user-specific brain
patterns. One of the most crucial factors for the practical success of these
systems is that this adaptation can be achieved with a minimum amount of
training data since training data needs to be recorded during a
calibration procedure prior to the actual usage session. To this end, one
promising approach is to reuse models based on data recorded in preceding
sessions of the same or of other users. In this paper, we investigate
under which conditions it is favorable to reuse models (more specifically
spatial filters) trained on data from historic sessions compared to learning new
spatial filters on the current session's calibration data. We present an
empirical study in a scenario in which Brain Reading, a particular kind of
brain-machine-interface, is used to support robotic telemanipulation.},
