        abstract = {We introduce a new online skill discovery method for reinforcement learning in
discrete domains. The method is based on the bottleneck principle and identifies
skills using a bottom-up hierarchical clustering of the estimated transition
graph. In contrast to prior clustering approaches, it can be used
incrementally and thus several times during the learning process. Our empirical
evaluation shows that ``assuming high connectivity in the face of uncertainty''
can prevent premature identification of skills. Furthermore, we show that the
choice of the linkage criterion is crucial for dealing with non-random sampling
policies and stochastic environments.},
