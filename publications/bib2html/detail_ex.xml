<![CDATA[
Simulations are an excellent tool for studying
artificial intelligence. However, the simulation
technology in use by and designed for the artificial
intelligence community often fails to take advantage
of much of the work by the larger simulation
community to produce stable, repeatable, and
efficient simulations. We present the new system
Middleware for Parallel Agent Discrete Event
Simulation (MPADES) as a simulation substrate for                  the
artificial intelligence community. MPADES                  focuses on
the agent as a fundamental simulation                  component. The
``thinking time'' of an agent is                  tracked and
reflected in the results of the agents'
actions. MPADES supports and manages the                  distribution
of agents across machines while being                  robust to
variations in network performance and                  machine
load. We present the system in detail and                  give
experimental results for a simple world model                  and set
of agents. MPADES is not tied to any                  particular
simulation, and is a powerful new tool                  for creating
simulations for the study of artificial
intelligence.
