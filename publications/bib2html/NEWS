  * textsc{} entries are now replaced with appropriate html (Thanks to
    Mark Moll)

0.93
  * \% in bib entries becomes % in xml/html (Thanks to Mark Moll)

0.92
  * abs_path is no longer used. This was causing bib2html to hang for
    a long time when the scriptdir was in AFS. Most people will not
    notice this change at all.

0.91
  * \_ is now replaced with _ in the output. (Thanks to Mark Moll)
  * Changed handling of ~ in author names. If author names have
    suffixes like Jr., Sr., etc, then you need to use ~ as the
    seprator between the last name and the suffix, e.g.  
    Patrick Riley,~Jr.
    If you don't do this, then bib2html will interpret Jr. as the last
    name. Note that you should not use ~ in names in any other way.
    (Thanks to Mark Moll)
  * trans_ex2.xsl has been updated to handle acents and other special
    html characters in classified by author pages.
  * The contents of the bib2html_extra_info field is no longer put
    through the standard tex to html replacements and output escaping
    is disable for the two translation examples.
  * Previously, if you used the accent \" in a bibtex field delimited
    with ", bib2html would fail parsing. Now any " preceded by \ is
    not considered the end of the field. (Thank you to Mark Moll for
    bringing this to my attention)
  * InCollection now has the "number" field (if it exists) in the
    citation.
  * A warning is printed if an entry is lacking both author and editor
    fields (which will probably cause bib2html to exit)
  * The return values of the programs which do the verification and
    transformation of the xml files are now checked. The new options
    xml_verify_exp_ret and xsl_transform_exp_ret give their expected
    values. The default of 0 should be fine for almost any program.
  * Added three new parameters: catlist_rescat_ignored,
    catlist_pubtype_ignored, catlist_funding_ignored
    The values given are accepted as valid for the category (so no
    warning is printed), but no output class is generated for anything
    in this list.
  * All the special bibtex fields that bib2html recognizes are
    configurable with these new options: bibfield_abstract,
    bibfield_wwwnote, bibfield_extra_info, bibfield_pubtype,
    bibfield_rescat, bibfield_funding, bibfield_dl_pdf,
    bibfield_dl_ps, bibfield_dl_psgz, bibfield_dl_html:
    bib2html_dl_html (Thanks to Mark Moll for the suggestion)
  * XML armoring for field has been improved (' " < >) are all
    protected now. URLs are also armored. In particular, this means
    that you can now use download URLs that include &
    (Thanks to Mark Moll for pointing out this bug)
  * If catlist_authors or catlist_authors_2 is empty, then a list of
    all authors is used. This list is constructed by finding the most
    general names used in the bib entries. For example, if I use both
    "Patrick Riley" and "P. Riley" in my bib entries, then "P. Riley"
    is used as the class name. Note that if I have "Patrick Riley",
    "George Riley" and "Riley", everything will end up under just
    "Riley".

0.90
  * Can now generate separate bib files for each paper (esp. useful if
    you don't use detail pages). The option 'generate_bibtex_files'
    controls whether this is done (default off). The multi-line option
    'bibtex_file_comments' contains additional comment lines to put at
    the top of each bib file (some comment lines giving attribution
    are always added). 
    The intermediate xml format has a 'bibtex_url' element in each
    paper_info element if the bibtex file was generated.
    Both example xsl files have been updated to use this.
    Thank you to Ran El-Yaniv <rani@cs.Technion.AC.IL> for this
    suggestion.
  * trans_ex2.xsl was malformatted in the last release; fixed
  * Now understand a new bibtex field bib2html_extra_info
    The contents of this field (which could be HTML) are put into the
    <extra_info> element of the paper info. This is intended for
    longer information than what is in wwwnote. This is useful for
    noting clarifications and conference/journal versions of
    papers. In the example xsl files, this information is printed only
    in the paper detail page.
    Thank you to Ran El-Yaniv <rani@cs.Technion.AC.IL> for this
    suggestion.
  * The formatting (notable upper/lower case) for authors in the
    classified by author pages is taken from the values specified in
    the conf file.
  * A new option has been added 'author_url'. This is a multi-line
    option where you can provide a URL for an author. Everytime that
    author name is in a citation, a link is created to the given
    URL. Each line has the format
    <name> | <url>
    e.g.
    Riley, Patrick     | http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pfr
    (note the last name, first name format)
    The link creation is handled in the perl, not the XSL, so you have
    no control over the formatting of the link. I know this is not
    ideal, but it would require some reworking to move that to the
    XSL. If you really need this, let me know and we can talk.
    Thank you to Ran El-Yaniv <rani@cs.Technion.AC.IL> for this
    suggestion.
  * bib2html now correctly ignore bib lines beginning with @comment

0.88
  * It has been discovered that perl 5.8.0 does NOT work with bib2html
    but 5.8.3 does (thank you to Hans Halvorson) 
  * The classified by author pages (with the associated
    catlist_authors and catlist_authors_2 parameters are now much
    smarter about matching/generating author names. In particular,
    names forms with more than just last name can now be used in those
    parameters. bib2html generates a number of name forms for every
    input author to try and match the name to the allowed list. The
    name forms are of the form
    <full last name>, <some full given names> <some initials>
    e.g.
    Riley, Patrick F.
    Riley, P. 
    Riley, P. F. 
    Riley
    This means that names like 'Riley, P.' can be used in the
    catlist_authors parameter, which can help resolve ambiguity if you
    have multiple people with the same last name. However, note that
    if there is more information in the catlist_authors value than in
    the bibentry, that bibentry will not be matched correctly. For example,
    if I have 'Patrick Riley' in the bibentry and 'Riley, P. F.' in
    catlist_authors, that entry will NOT be classified because
    bib2html does not know if 'Patrick Riley' is the same as 'Riley,
    P. F.' 
  * Fixed test.bib (had some old formatting styles in it)
  * trans_ex1.bib and trans_ex2.bib now handle
    list_papers_by_author_class

0.87
  * Removed dependence on Time::Zone. Time zone information is no
    longer included output html (in the generation date). I modified
    the example translations like this to avoid mistaken time zone
    information being printed.
   <xsl:with-param name="pattern" select="'EEE MMM dd, yyyy HH:mm:ss zzz'" />
   to
   <xsl:with-param name="pattern" select="'EEE MMM dd, yyyy HH:mm:ss'" />
   You should probably update your xsl in the same way.
  * The abstract now gets html from tex markup applied to it (see next
    change also).
  * In the example XSL files, I removed otput escaping for the
    abstract. This allows the formatting from 0.86 to be applied to
    the abstract, but has the potential to create bad HTML if you have
    characters like &, <, or > in your abstracts. If you do, you
    probably don't want to make this change in your xsl:
    <xsl:value-of select="b2h:paper_info/b2h:abstract"/> 
    to
    <xsl:value-of select="b2h:paper_info/b2h:abstract" disable-output-escaping="yes" /> 

0.86
  * {\it } and {\bf } formatting is correctly turned into html
  * \url now turned into links (and \char"7E turned into ~)
  * Warning about malformatted entry now includes key if it can
  * Support for html versions of papers added. In order to make this
    work, the URL for the detail page has been changed to include a
    b2hd- in front of the file name. I realize this will break any
    URLs that you have distributed. My workaround is to make a custom
    error page like http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~pfr/publications/404.html
    and put something like this in the .htaccess for the directory
    with your publications (this assumes you are running Apache I
    think): 
    ErrorDocument 404 /~pfr/publications/404.html

0.85
  * Added support for \btohremove. Anything inside this command is
    removed before formatting for the web pages. It can handle nested
    {}, but they must be balanced. If remove_bib2html_fields is true,
    then these are also removed for the output of the whole BibTeX
    entry.
  * Added option 'title_html_tag' (default empty). Gives an html tag
    to put around the formatting of every title.

0.84
  * Added support for a bib2html_ignore field. If it exists and has
    any true value, that entry is not processed. Thank you to Peter
    Stone for this.
  * Fixed a bug (reported by Peter Stone) on the use of ~ and '\ ' in
    titles. The fix partially relies on changes in bib2html.pl, but
    you may also need to change your XSL file. I have updated both the
    example XSL files as follows. In the b2h:paper_detail, changed
    this line: 
  <h2> <xsl:value-of select="b2h:paper_info/b2h:title" /> </h2>
    to this:
  <h2> <xsl:value-of select="b2h:paper_info/b2h:title" disable-output-escaping="yes"/> </h2>
    Basically, this allows the $nbsp; to get passed through correctly. 

0.83
  * Unfortunately, the previous fix didn't actually fix the bug (see
    0.82). Now it really is fixed.

0.82
  * Fixed a problem (caused by the duplicate handling code) that
    prevented key names with : or + in them from locating their
    download files.

0.81
  * Added a catlist_author configuration option. If generating and
    author_class page, only authors in this list are given
    categories. If the list is empty, all authors are given categories.
  * Added support for an author_class_2 file type which is like
    author_class but uses the new catlist_authors_2 multi-line conf
    option.
  * Added conf options: default_title, date_title, author_title,
    author_class_title, author_class_2_title, pubtype_title,
    rescat_title, funding_title, index_title
    These specify the titles of all of the pages.
  * Added conf option suppress_classify_warnings (default 0) which
    suppresses the warning about class values not being in the allowed
    list.
  * Added conf option merge_duplicates, which specifies to try and
    merge duplicate entires. Details in directions.txt.
  * Added conf option output_bibfile, which if non-empty specifies a
    file to write all the bib entries used to generate the web pages
    (in bibtex format). Notably, this is output after the merge of
    bibtex entries.

0.80
  * Added some basic error checking on bib entries to avoid mysterious
    warnings later.
  * Class names are canonicalized to multiple spaces becoming one
    space, both in the bib entries and in the .conf file entries.
  * Added an author_class output file list type which outputs the
    papers with the any author's last name as a classification
    type. In order to get special characters printed correctly, you
    may need to put disable-output-escaping="yes" in your xsl:value-of
    elements of printing the group title.
  * Sorting by first author last name was broken with the use of
    ~. Fixed.
  * Sorting by first author last name now puts in headers for internal
    linking which you can use in your xsl file.
  * Added a function (turned off by default) to write .bib files for
    each first author. You can turn it on by editing the perl (see
    create_files_from_class)
  * Added support for multiple conf files. bib2html.conf is still read
    first. Anything else on the command line that ends with .conf will
    also be read as a conf file (and not read for bib entries).
  * Added new classification type: bib2html funding produces a
    "list_papers_by_funding" xml element which uses the categories
    from the multiline conf "catlist_funding" and the
    "bib2html_funding" element of the bib file entries.
  * Added a quiet conf option to suppress all normal status output.
  * Added a check for multiple entries with the same key.
  * Added a status bar for reading bib files

0.74
  * Minor fix that papers without classification did not end up in the
    Unspecified category
  * ~ and '\\ ' becomes &nbsp; 
  * is_str_in_list function was broken. This caused warnings not be
    printed when categories not specified in the conf file were used.

0.73
  * Many more replacements for latin-1 character (like umlauts and
    cedilla, etc.) (thanks to Mark Moll)

0.72
  * Do umlaut replacement (thanks to Oliver Obst)
  * Added entried for @manual and @misc (thanks to Oliver Obst)
  * If a local copy of the file can not be found, the field
    bib2html_dl_EXT (where EXT is the file extension with . removed)
    is checked. If this field exists, it is assumed to be a URL to
    link for this version of the paper. (based on code from Oliver Obst)

0.71
  * (not ever publically released)
  * Entries with space after @NAME were ignored. Fixed.
  * String exansion was not always done if the name was uppercase
  * Size templates fixed
  * Thanks to Mark Moll, another xsl example
  * bad attributes removed to generate valid html 4.01 transitional
 
0.7
  * (not ever publically released)
  * This is an almost complete rewrite of the output
    functions. bib2html.pl now produces xml which conforms to the
    bib2html.xsd schema. An XSL file is then used to translate the XML
    to HTML. This should allow you to perform all customization by
    changing the xsl file, and not the bib2html.pl script. When
    upgrading to this version, you will need to spent a little time
    modifying the translation file to suit your needs.

0.46
  * Keys can now include '.'
  * Field names can now include '-:.'
  * Failed reading of an entry is now a warning, not an error
